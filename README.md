# Would You Rather Project

This is the code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

## How it works / Features

A user can log in (currently one of three possible users), select a question (would you rather?), and choose a preferred option.

For example:  
Would you rather

- be telekinetic
- be telepathic

A logged-in user can also create a question (with two options of course) for others to answer/vote on

There is the option of a leaderboard, displaying how many questions were answered per uesr
